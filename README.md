# SEMM
Security Engineering Maturity Matrix is a maturity model similar to the Department of Energy Cybersecurity Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model (C2M2) in that it leverages a 3 tiered approach to define the capabilities of an organizations security engineering processes. Unlike the SSE-CMM which is based more on specific security activities, the SEMM breaks down the security engineering process into the following practices areas:

* Planning
* Design
* Build
* Test
* Deploy
* Operate

SEMM seeks to define the practices that should be considered for a mature security organization, but does not specify the security requirements or frameworks to be used as this will vary for every organizations. This project will be maintained as an open source contribution, but its practices can also be found in the Opswright Impact platform available at https://opswright.com
